/* Assignment
Run the code as-is. You should see that it doesn't do anything interesting: no ping or pong messages are printed.

Fix the bug in the pingPong function.

Remember: if a program exits before its goroutines have completed, those goroutines will be killed silently.
Which of the function calls probably shouldn't run in the background as a goroutine? */
